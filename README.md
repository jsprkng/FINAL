## Features

### 1. Task List (Create Task)
**Fields:**
- **Task Name:** Brief title of the task.
- **Task Description (Optional):** Details or notes about the task.
- **Due Date:** Select via a user-friendly calendar picker (like Google Forms).
- **Task Status:** Dropdown with options:
  - Not Yet Started
  - In Progress
  - Completed
- **Difficulty & Time Estimation:**
  - Easy (â‰¤ 1 hour)
  - Medium (1-4 hours)
  - Hard (5+ hours, or multi-day projects)
  - Users provide an estimated time to complete the task.
- **Timing Suggestions:** Based on difficulty and due date proximity, tasks are tagged:
  - "Do Immediately" (Urgent, due soon)
  - "Start Early" (Medium priority, due in a few days)
  - "Schedule Later" (Low priority, due in a week or more)

### 2. Task List (Edit Task and Delete Task)
Allows modification of:
- Task name, description, due date, status, difficulty, and estimated time.
- Automatically updates prioritization and timing suggestions when edits are made.

### 3. Suggested Workflow (Prioritization Sorting)
**Smart Workflow Suggestion Algorithm:**
Ranks tasks based on:
- **Due Date:** Nearer deadlines get higher priority.
- **Task Difficulty:** Harder tasks with long estimated times are pushed earlier.
- **Estimated Time Left:** Tasks are grouped to fit into available time slots.

**Suggested Workflow View:**
Dynamically reorders tasks into a streamlined, effective sequence.

### 4. Dashboard (Home Page)
- **Task Summaries:**
  - **Tasks Left:** Total number of pending tasks.
  - **Hours Remaining:** Cumulative estimate of hours to finish all tasks.
- **Difficulty Breakdown:**
  - Tasks tagged as "Do Immediately," "Start Early," or "Schedule Later."
- **Completion Progress:** Tracks how many tasks were completed recently.

### 5. Settings
**Feature Name: "Flexible Work Hours"**

**Purpose:**
Allows users to input or modify their available working hours, ensuring the suggested workflow view avoids conflicts with non-working times (e.g., classes, meetings, or personal commitments). The workflow dynamically rearranges tasks to fit within available time slots.

**How It Works:**
- **Define Work Hours:**
  - Users can set their daily work schedule (e.g., 9 AM - 12 PM, 2 PM - 5 PM).
  - Option to exclude specific times for commitments (e.g., classes, meetings).
- **Dynamic Task Rearrangement:**
  - Smart Workflow Suggestion Algorithm automatically rearranges tasks to fit within available work hours.
  - Tasks are redistributed to avoid conflicts and maintain productivity.
- **Visual Schedule Integration:**
  - Displays a daily/weekly calendar showing:
    - Allocated work hours.
    - Non-working time blocks (e.g., shaded sections for classes/meetings).
    - Task placements within the available slots.
